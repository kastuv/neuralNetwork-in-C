*Single input Single output Neural Network*
-> The single value is input through the neural wrong and it interacts with the weight in and gives single predicted value.
Let's say this is a single neural networks to predict if the person is sad or happy. We can consider sad and happy to be a neumerical value,
we could say that the number above 10 means the person is happy or else the person is sad.

To interprete this simple example;

int happyORsad(input, weight)
{
    int prediction = input * weight;
    return prediction;
}

Let's see how this workes.
