*Single input Single output Neural Network*
-> The single value is input through the neural network and it interacts with the weight in and gives single predicted value.
Let's say this is a single neural networks to predict if the person is sad or happy. We can consider sad and happy to be a neumerical value,
we could say that the number above 10 means the person is happy or else the person is sad.

To interprete this simple example;

int happyORsad(input, weight)
{
    int prediction = input * weight;
    return prediction;
}

*Single input Multiple output Neural Network*
-> Multiple values can be sent through the input and it interacts with unique weights and gives multiple out puts.

To interprete this simple example;

void (input, weight, output)
{
    for(int i =0; i < length_of_weight; i++)
    {
        output[i] = input * weight[i];
    }
}
