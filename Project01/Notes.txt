*Normalization*
We normalize data to make the dataset under same treshold to minimize the data difference. There are few techniques to normalize data.
We can always choose to use different formulas and see which one can work best for our work. Or we can always try to built our own algorithm, if capable.

Here we are normalizing the data by diving the datas by the largest data. Formula :

Xnor = (X / X max)

*Weight Initialization*
